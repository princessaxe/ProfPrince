<h1 class= "Trio">My Trio 2024 Experience</h1>
<div>
<p>My Trio experience this year was phenomenal. I love being able to get out from home, learn about college, and relate to others in the program with the same feelings. During Trio summer I was able to get the chance of not being home doing nothing; from academic days to different cultural experiences, Trio has allowed me to gain more confidence and knowledge about college. My favorite class for the summer was ASL, because it is something new that I can now incorporate into my future. I will continue to enjoy Trio and all the opportunities that come with it.</p>
