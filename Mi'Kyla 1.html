<h2> My Trio Experience
</p> My favorite class was between Finacial Literacy and ASL. I love the way Ms.Mattias explained financial terms to the point where I could understand efficiently. I love the content Mrs.West provided, along with the way each lesson was structured. My favorite experience was the Criminal Justice one, as each speaker was extraordinary. Both of them showed very interesting subjects/activites. I liked touring the building as well.
