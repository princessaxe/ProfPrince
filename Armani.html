<h2> My Trio 24 Experience</h2>
<p> My Trio 2024 was probably one of the best summers i have had in a while and i got to experience many new things.
 I met some AMAZING new AC'S and built better bonds with old ones.
 My favorite class was with Ms.Prince aka ROBOTICS!!!!
Skating was my FAVORITE cultural experience because i love to skate but also i enjoyed Water Rapids since we were able to play and have fun with following TRIO members.
If i was to rate this summer out of ten it would be an 1000/10. I Love MY TRIO Family!
