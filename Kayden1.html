<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a 11th grader at Deerfield Beach High school. I am in the Trio Upward Bound Program.
I am Jamaican, Haitian, and Bahamian. I enjoy playing basketball, dancing, and reading.
I also love going shopping and going to the book store. My favorite color is pink. I skipped a grade so
technically i'm suppose to be in 10th (smarty pants yeah i know). </p>
