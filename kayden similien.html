<h2>My Trio 24 Experience</h2>
<p>My experience during the Trio 24 Summer program was a very fun experience. A time was had I will say that.
My favorite class is probably robotics/coding because of the fact that I learned how to make a website
and learned how to control a robot. My favorite cultural experience was probably tiger tails since i've never
been and had a very fun time.</p>
