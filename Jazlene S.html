<h2> My Trio 24 Experience 
</p> My favorite class was ASL. We had it last year but this time it was more advanced and fun. My favorite cultural experience would have to be water rapids. I enjoyed it because of the rides along with my friends that were there. The wave pool was my most liked part even though I almost drowned.
